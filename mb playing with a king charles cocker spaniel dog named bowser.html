<h1>When I play with Bowser</h1>
<p><strong>If you havn't seen <a href="what a king charles cocker spaniel dog named Bowser likes to do.html">www.what a king charles cocker spaniel dog named Bowser likes to do.html</a>, then see that.</strong></p>
<p>We (Bowser and I) always play together. <a href="gets crazy and bites playfully.html">This picture</a> with blood coming out of my knee, <a href="bloarm.html">this picture</a> with blood coming out of my elbow, and <a href="sup.html">this picture</a> with blood coming out of my head is not real. He does not bite like that. His playfull biting is actually fun.</p>
<p>The only problem is that when he bites me playfully, sometimes it forces me to lie down. And when he forces me to lie down, sometimes he bites my head. AND IT HURTS!</p>
<p>I have two choices:</p>
<ol>
<li>Scream so that my mom upstairs can hear me,</li>
<li>or go upstairs and tell my mom about my ouchie.</li>
</ol>
<p>(See <a href="when mb plays with a king charles cocker spaniel dog named bowser under adults supervision.html">Link#4</a> to see what happens if I get hurt from Bowser under adults supervision.)</p>
