<p>Introduction: The Wild Robot is  the title of my book. The author/illistrator of this book is Peter Brown. It all starts when Roz arrives at the island on accident. She learns to communicate with other animals. Also, She adopts a son (or goose). So far, she believes this is her real life. 3 Recos come to the island in an aircraft to take Roz. Roz is almost destroyed and she wants to save the island. Because of that, the story ends in an aircraft.</p>

<p>Characters: The main character of this story is Roz. She has quite a few character traits. The first one is Helpful. This is the main trait that powers all the other traits. For example, all the animals were thinking of what Roz was made to do. Every single thig they thought of includes Roz helping the animals. Roz thinks she is made to help others. She is also brave. After 3 Recos come, she was brave enough to go in the aircraft and make plans to escape her "REAL LIFE". another trait is Smart. She was smart enough to make traps, defeat the Recos, and escape. Last but not least, we have friendly. Roz learns to speak animal language. Since she is so helpful, she makes friends with all the animals.</p>

<p>Setting: This story takes place in the wilderness, on an island, during all the seasons of the year. There are lots of animals, trees, rocks, mountains, and ponds.</p>

<p>Plot: Roz arrives at an island Because of a cargo ship that sinks because of a huricane. Roz makes friends with the entire island. Out of nowhere, three Recos come. The Recos almost completely destroy Roz and the nature on the island. Once the Recos are destroyed, Roz goes in the aircraft the Recos left behind, and flies away.</p>

<p>Conclusion: All this information is coming to a closing. I think that the island IS her real home. I think the Recos should have left her alone. People who are interested in robots and nature should read this book. A lesson learned. Whereever your born, is where you should live.</p>
